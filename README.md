# `seed-springboot` — Seed for Spring Boot Systelab projects

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [Spring Boot][sboot] backend application. You can use it
to quickly bootstrap your projects and dev environment.

The seed contains a Patient Management sample application and is preconfigured to install the JEE
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant development gratification.

The app doesn't do too much, just shows how to use different standards and other suggested tools together:

* Spring Boot
* Spring Boot Web
* Spring Boot Data JPA
* [JWT][jwt]
* [CORS][cors]
* [Swagger][swagger]
* Spring Boot Security
* Spring Boot Test
* [Allure][allure] with [JUnit][junit]

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `seed-springboot` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need [git][git] to clone the `seed-springboot` repository.

You will need [Java™ SE Development Kit 8][jdk-download] and [Maven][maven].

### Clone `seed-springboot`

Clone the `seed-springboot` repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/systelab/seed-springboot.git
cd seed-springboot
```

### Install Dependencies

In order to install the dependencies and generate the Uber jar you must run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run

To launch the server, simply run with java -jar the generated jar file.

```bash
cd target
java -jar seed-springboot-1.0.jar
```

### Certificate

A self signed certificate is provided in order to show use how to setup the application.

The certificate was generated with the following commands:

```bash
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 365 -keysize 2048
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.jks -destkeystore keystore.p12 -deststoretype pkcs12
```

> Do not use the certificate provided in production and never put any secret in your application.yml file.


## API

You will find the swagger UI at https://localhost:8443/swagger-ui.html and http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html 

First generate a token by login as user Systelab and password Systelab. After that authorize Swagger by copying the bearer.

Head to https://localhost:8443/hystrix and setup the URL https://localhost:8443/actuator/hystrix.stream in order to get the Hystrix Dashboard.

## Docker

### Build docker image

There is an Automated Build Task in Docker Cloud in order to build the Docker Image. 
This task, triggers a new build with every git push to your source code repository to create a 'latest' image.
There is another build rule to trigger a new tag and create a 'version-x.y.z' image

You can always manually create the image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t systelab/seed-springboot . 
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8443:8443 -p 8080:8080 systelab/seed-springboot
```

The app will be available at https://localhost:8443/swagger-ui.html
